### SportsTimeTracker

## Summary

After working out the problems, the program works as intended.
The program was created using Java ja tested with JUnit-tests.
It was uploaded to GitHub to host the sourcecode. 
Jenkinsfile and Dockerfile were added and edited through it.
In Jenkins, new item was made that was taken from this GitHub-repo and constructed through Jenkinsfiles pipeline instructions.
With the pipeline a Docker repository and images were created.
Finally the program was ran through Virtual Machine hosted by [Docker Playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).
There it was pulled and ran from Docker and worked as it should.
